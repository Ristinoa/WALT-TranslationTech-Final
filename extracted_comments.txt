29 "It has been a long day, speaking with strangers and trying to sell them cookies,"
31 "The Cookie Crumble, with all the latest flavors!"
33 "There's been a couple of bites, but many have declined the cookies, claiming to bake their own cookies."
35 "As you are walking, you come to the final house on your route."
37 "Double checking the address, you pause,"
39 "I guess this is the place. It looks a little run down though."
43 "You've seen worse houses, usually in the newspaper. The grass has grown wild, the windows are covered up, and the gutters are full of dead leaves."
45 "Does anybody actually live here?"
47 "The path to the front door is choked with weeds, and you decided to wear shorts today."
49 "Just my luck!"
54 "Well it's getting late. I don't think anybody lives here after all."
55 "Turning away, you leave the house behind. When you reach the end of the block, a sudden wind comes from behind, pushing at you."
56 "Looking back, you see nothing out of the ordinary."
57 "That was weird."
58 "Shaking your head, you return to walking."
59 "You'll take the bus home, and that night, you sleep soundly. You've done a lot of walking today, and tomorrow's a new day."
66 "Fighting your way through the weeds, you climb up the steps to stand in front of the door."
67 "There's an ancient doorbell to the right, and beyond that a window. The lights are off, and it looks like something has been put over the window, but a small, dark hole exists."
68 "Is anybody home?"
73 "You go to knock on the door, but your hand passes through the air as the door opens."
78 "Who tries the doorknob to an abandoned house? You, apparently, and you are rewarded by the door opening soundlessly."
83 "{i}Thats weird.{i}"
87 "Is anybody home?"
89 "As you look through the doorway, you hear a loud {b}THUMP{/b} from above you, like someone falling off a bed."
91 "Is everything alright?"
93 "You take step inside the door, towards the stairs,"
95 "Did somebody just fall?"
97 "Suddenly a wind blows , seemingly from down the stairs, and the door slams shut behind you with a BANG."
99 "Spinning, you realize that she's something standing between you and the door; it's easily as tall as the ceiling, even taller, with long, shadowy arms and a big, misshapen head of darkness. Ivory-colored eyes shine, and then there's nothing."
108 "You've had a long day selling cookies, going from door to door."
110 "This is the last house on the block."
115 "You look up to see a two-story building, with what looks like an attic on top of that."
117 "I guess this is the place."
